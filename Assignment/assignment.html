HTML SEO
Additional Tags for SEO include:

>>1. Viewport Meta Tag.
Declaration: <meta name="Viewport" content="wiwidth=device-width, initial-scale=1">

This tag ensures that your web page is optimised to display your content properly across various device width sizes. It is useful for SEO becuase most people use hand held devices other than computers to access websites. If your site is not diplayed properly across the available devices, users would be turned off and will hardly spend time on your website. This adversely affects ranking for your site.

>>2. Canonical Tags.
Declaration: <link rel="canonical" href="https://mywebsite.com/">

Due to the fact that a website can be accessed using the URL in different formats, the ranking can be spread or shared amongst the different URL formats. Take for instance, the following links can link to the same site:
** https://mywebsite.com/
** https://www.mywebsite.com/

Now at the end of the day, the ranking is shared. To avoid this, you make use of the canonical tags where apprpriate. It tells the ranking algorithm to focus on the URL you set as the href value.

>>3. Robots Meta Tags.
Declaration: <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
Sometimes you have content on your page that you consider of low quality and you do not want it to be referenced or indexed for ranking because it is likely to give you a poor ranking thereby affecting your overall ranking. In such a case, the Robots Meta Tags come in very handy.
